              <p class="card-text">Palakkad, otherwise known by its anglicized name Palghat, is a district in Kerala that lies along the serpentine mountain ranges of the Western Ghats.
                   What makes Palakkad distinct from other parts of Kerala is its predominantly rural nature coupled with enormous expanses of paddy fields.
                    Endless stretch of palm trees, green carpeted landscapes, dense tropical forests and undulating hilly terrains make Palakkad a visual treat to spectators.
                     By contributing massively to the rice production of Kerala, Palakkad has rightfully grabbed two titles - ‘The Rice Bowl of Kerala’ and ‘The Granary of Kerala’.
                     Palakkad is credited with a good number of sightseeing options including forts, temples, dams, wildlife sanctuaries, waterfalls, parks and picturesque landscapes.
                      Palakkad Fort and Jain Temple are of significant historical interest and draws travellers throughout the year.
                      
                       Nelliampathi Hill Station, Silent Valley National Park and Parambikkulam Wildlife Sanctuary offer nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts with a delightful holidaying experience.
                       
                         Palakkad enjoys good connectivity by rail and road and the climate of the region is pleasant throughout the year except
                          for the summers.
                           The rare amalgam of traditions, scenic stretches of landscapes, exceptional sightseeing options and the hues of festivities make Palakkad a much sought-after travel destination in South India.

            </h3>
            <p class="card-text">At a distance of 53 km from Palakkad, & 102 km from Coimbatore, Silent Valley National Park is a national park located in the northeast corner of Palakkad district in Kerala. It is one of the famous national parks in Kerala, and among the top Palakkad tourist places.

                Silent Valley National Park is a beautiful representation of the last remaining rain-forest of Kerala. Historically it is a paradigm of people's movement to protect the forest. In 1914, Silent Valley forests were declared as Reserved Forest. It was declared as National Park in 1984 and formally inaugurated in the year 1985. Till 1921, Silent Valley was part of the South Malabar Forest Division with headquarters at Nilambur. In 1921, it came under the control of the Palakkad Forest Division and managed so until 1988.
                 
                Silent Valley was called 'Sairandhrivanam' as it was the place where Sairandhiri (the secret identity donned by Panchali, from the epic Mahabharata) hid along with her five husbands, the Pandavas, during their exile. The Kunthippuzha River which feeds the entire forest was named after Kunthi, the mother of the Pandavas.
                
                Initially, the park has only 89.52 sq. km area that forms the core zone of the National Park while in 2007, an area of 148 sq. km was added to this as a buffer zone. It is one of the smallest national parks in India and among the must-include places in Palakkad sightseeing packages. The altitude of the park varies between 658 to 2383 meters. It is shielded by the Nilgiri Plateau to the North and the Mannarkkad Plains to the South. It constitutes the centerpiece of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, sanctified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2012.
                
                This is one of the best places of wildlife near Coimbatore. The park provides shelter for a variety of species including elephants, tigers, leopards, wild boar, sambhar, gaur, and the endangered lion-tailed macaque. Along with them, one can view over 1000 species of flowering plants and another 110 species of orchids here. Over 400 species of moths and 200 species of butterflies have been cataloged here.
                
                The Silent Valley core zone has National Park status while the buffer area has Reserve forest status. The headquarters of both ranges are at Mukkali and the Divisional office is at Mannarkkad. The National Park along with the buffer zone is a part of Nilambur Elephant Reserve declared under Project Elephant. Mukkali (on Mannarkad-Anaikatti-Coimbatore road) is the entry point to the park where private Jeeps are found to get into the park (guides are also available here). Vehicles are allowed till Sairandhri watchtower (23 km from Mukkali).
                 Visitors can trek to the Kunthi River from the watchtower (1.5 km).

            </h3>
            <p class="card-text">At a distance of 2 km from Palakkad Railway Station, Tippu's Fort is an ancient fort situated in the heart of Palakkad town in Kerala. It is one of the best preserved heritage forts in Kerala, and among the must-visit places during Palakkad trip.

                Also known as Tipu's Fort, Palakkad Fort is believed to have existed since ancient times, but the present form of the fort was constructed by the great ruler of Mysore, Haider Ali in 1766 AD. Named after Hyder's son Tipu Sultan, it was under the Mysore rulers until the British took control of the place in the year. Later, it was converted into a taluk office in the early 1900s. Now, the fort is protected & managed by the Archeological Survey of India.
                
                Spread over an area of 60,702 sq. m, Palakkad Fort is immensely famous for its architecture, which displays the efficiency of the French craftsman. This square-shaped fort is supported by walls and bastions. Earlier, the entrance to the fort was via a drawbridge, which has now been replaced by a permanent one in its place. There is a large ground between the Fort and the Palakkad Townhall, known as Kota Maidanam which is now used to stage cricket matches, exhibitions, and public meetings.
                
                An open-air auditorium called Rappadi is also located within the spacious grounds of the Fort.
                 The Palakkad Fort also houses some other smaller attractions such as the Hanuman temple, Martyr's column, Anjaneya Swami Temple, Vatika Shilavatika (a garden), and a sub-jail.
                 The fort is considered one of the famous Palakkad sightseeing places.</p>

            </h3>
            <p class="card-text">A three-hour trek from the base of the Dhoni hills will take you to the pristine beauty of nature and the lush green surroundings will rejuvenate your senses. The trekking starts at the foot of the hills near the Teak plantations.
                 A narrow mountain way is there for four-wheel drives and bikes that lead up to the waterfall; however private vehicles are prohibited from traversing these roads. This 4 km long trekking trail through the lush green environs bestows one with a quiet isolated space to witness nature in its most tranquil form. This guided trek is best to start trekking early mornings, so more time can be spent in the company of the gorgeous waterfall. 

                The waterfalls are full during monsoon and it overflows with beautiful small streams gushing down, so the best time to visit is during monsoon (June – October). Bathing in the waterfall is not allowed, though there are places down the stream for bathing. The return journey is comparatively easy lasting usually around 2 hours.
