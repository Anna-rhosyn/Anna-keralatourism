              <p class="card-text">Called the ‘Evergreen city of India’, Thiruvananthapuram is the capital of the state of Kerala. The city comprises beautiful beaches, long stretches of palm fringed shorelines, windy backwaters and historical structures. Along with its natural and historical significance, the city is also popular for its ancient temples that are renowned for their architecture making Thiruvananthapuram one of the most visited pilgrim centers of India.

                In the late 17th century, the city was the capital of the Travancore kingdom that was ruled by the Varma dynasty. After forming the Travancore kingdom, Maharaja Marthanada Varma dedicated it to Lord Padmanabha, the presiding deity of Shri Padmanabhaswamy temple and named the city ‘Thiruvananthapuram’.
                
                The word ‘Thiruvananthapuram’ is derived from the Malayalam word thiru- anantha-puram, which means ‘City of Lord Ananta’. Ananta is the serpent Shesha on whom Lord Padmanabha (another form of Lord Vishnu) reclines. During the British era, the name of the city was anglicized to Trivandrum and it was the official name of the city, until 1991, when the government renamed the city to Thiruvananthapuram.
                
                The Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple is one of the prominent attractions of the city. Devotees in large numbers visit the temple every year. It’s popular for its architectural splendor and historical and religious significance.
                
                Thiruvananthapuram is also a paradise for beach lovers. Beaches situated outside the city like the Shankhumugham and Kovalam beaches are world famous.
