            <p class="card-text">Illikkal Kallu is one of the popular tourist destinations in the Kottayam district of Kerala. Illikkal Kallu extends the roots of Western Ghats in Kottayam and Idukki districts. And in this article let's list down the complete details about Illikkal Kallu, Illikkal Kallu history, route, entry fees, etc.

                Illikkal Kallu is at about 4000-6000 ft. above sea level and is one of the popular destinations in Kerala. It is otherwise called as Illikka Kallu, Ikkikan Mala, Illicka Mala, etc. Illicka Mala comprises of three hills, and each of the hills has a peculiar shape.
                
                One of them resembles a mushroom, which is known as Kuda Kallu (English: umbrella-shaped rock). It is said that the medicinal herb Neela Koduveli grows here. This blue colored flower is believed to have supernatural powers, which could increase wealth and ensure a rich harvest.
                
                The second hill has a small hunch on the sides and is thus referred to as Koonu Kallu (hunch back rock). Across this rock is a 1/2 ft.-wide bridge called Narakapalam (English: bridge to hell). From the top of Illikan Mala, the Arabian Sea can be seen on the distant horizon as a thin blue line.
                
                Illickan Mala is famous for its solitude, the quietude and the gentle breeze that blows there. There are so many mountain streams originating from here which later forms the Meanechil River.
